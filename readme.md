# Typing Speed Test

This is a simple typing speed test that measures your typing speed, accuracy, and time taken to type a given text. The test includes the following features:

- Displays your typing speed in words per minute (WPM)
- Tracks your typing accuracy as a percentage
- Shows the time taken to complete the test
- Provides real-time feedback as you type
- Alerts you when the test is completed

## Features

- **Speed**: Measures your typing speed in words per minute (WPM).
- **Accuracy**: Displays your typing accuracy as a percentage of correct characters.
- **Time**: Tracks how much time you have spent typing.
- **Real-time Updates**: The typing speed, accuracy, and time are updated in real-time as you type.
- **Test Reset**: Option to reset the test and start over.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the test interface.
- **CSS**: For styling the test interface.
- **JavaScript**: For the logic behind the typing test (calculating speed, accuracy, time, etc.).

## How It Works

The JavaScript code tracks your input and compares it to a predefined text. The following steps occur:

1. **Starting the Test**: When you begin typing, the timer starts, and the system tracks the number of characters typed.
2. **Accuracy Calculation**: As you type, the number of correct characters is calculated.
3. **Typing Speed**: Your typing speed is calculated in words per minute (WPM) based on the number of characters typed and the time taken.
4. **Completion**: When the entire text is typed correctly, an alert is shown to congratulate you, and the test ends.
5. **Resetting**: You can reset the test and start again at any time.



### HTML Structure

The HTML provides the structure for displaying the test, including the text to type, input field, and elements to show time, speed, and accuracy.
